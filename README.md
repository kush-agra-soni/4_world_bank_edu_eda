## Introduction
The aim of this project is to explore the World Education Bank dataset through data cleaning, data transformation, and visualization techniques to uncover insights into global education metrics.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains various education-related metrics across multiple countries, including:
- Literacy rates
- Education spending
- Enrollment rates
- Demographic information

## Project Objectives
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and incorrect data types.
2. **Data Transformation**: Standardize, scale, and encode features as needed.
3. **Visualization**: Create charts to visualize trends, distributions, and correlations.
4. **Insight Generation**: Identify trends, regional differences, and critical educational factors.

## Technologies Used
- `Python`
- `Jupyter Notebook`
- `Pandas`, `NumPy` - for data manipulation and analysis
- `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` - for data visualization
- `Scikit-Learn` - for basic data preprocessing
